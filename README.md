#Genetic Variant Classification
Project Theme:
This project includes a Python script made for tasks involving machine learning and data analysis on gene variants. 
The script covers a number of steps in the data science pipeline, such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data reading, and the use of supervised and unsupervised learning methods.

Description:
The script starts by loading the necessary libraries for machine learning, data visualization, and data manipulation. It mounts the Google Colab disk and establishes a random seed for reproducibility.  Presenting summary statistics, verifying column information, and displaying the first few rows are all part of the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
The script creates a count plot for the target variable, a correlation heatmap for numerical columns, and histograms for characteristics in the EDA section. To achieve data balancing, the majority class is downsampled. Plots showing the distribution of classes before and after are displayed. The code then goes on to preprocess the data, which includes defining features and target variables, splitting the data into train and test, using StandardScaler to standardize the data, and applying one-hot encoding to categorical features.The script uses K-Means clustering on numerical columns to investigate unsupervised learning.
   Ultimately Python enables a wide range of exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and supervised (K-Means clustering) and unsupervised (Logistic Regression) learning tasks related to machine learning. Its features can be adjusted to suit different datasets and promote cooperative contributions, so it's flexible and always improving in terms ofÂ functionality.
